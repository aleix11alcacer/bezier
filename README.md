# Bezier curves and surfaces

This project allows calculate a Bezier curve or a Bezier surface from a control points list.

- File `bezier-curve-2d.py` represents a Bezier curve in two dimensions.

- File `bezier-curve.py` represents a Bezier curve in three dimensions.

- File `bezier-surface.py` represents a Bezier surface in three dimensions.
